**ADNI**

Plots T1 intensities across the 5 major central balls in the ADNI phantom. This allows us to measures relative intensity fluctuations across time and between sites. Individual sites can be turned on and off by clicking on their entry in the legend.

**fMRI**

Plots QC metrics derived from the [fBIRN](http://www.birncommunity.org/resources/supplements/fbirn-recommendations-for-multi-center-fmri-studies/supplement-iv-fbirn-quality-assurance-program/) pipeline. This allows us to assess the stability of the EPI sequences used in our study over time. Individual sites can be turned on and off by clicking on their entry in the legend.  

**SPINS**

The SPINS project aims to identify deficits in social cognition amongst schizophrenia sub-populations. These groups are partcularly hard to help using current treatments, and insight into the underpinnings of this subtype of the disorder may lead to improved treatment outcomes.

**REPO**

The data presented on this site is a curated selection of our ongoing analysis output. More detailed data, and their associated pipelines, are available on our [GitHub](https://github.com/TIGRLab/spins).
