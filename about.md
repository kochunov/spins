The SPINS project aims to identify deficits in social cognition amongst schizophrenia sub-populations. These groups are partcularly hard to help using current treatments, and insight into the underpinnings of this subtype of the disorder may lead to improved treatment outcomes.

The data presented on this site is a curated selection of our ongoing analysis output. More detailed data, and their associated pipelines, are available on our Github.
